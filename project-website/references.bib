    abstract = { We review recent advances in hockey analytics research, most of which have occurred from the early 2000s to the present day. We discuss these advances in the context of earlier attempts to evaluate player performance in hockey. We survey the unique challenges of quantitatively summarizing the game of hockey, and how deficiencies in existing methods of evaluation shaped major avenues of research and the creation of new metrics. We present an extended analysis of the National Hockey League entry draft in terms of both retrospective evaluation and prospective strategy. We conclude with recommendations for future research in hockey analytics. }
